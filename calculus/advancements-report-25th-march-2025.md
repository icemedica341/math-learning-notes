# Precalculus Revisit - Clarifying Misconceptions

## Square Root of a Square
- The square root of $x^2$ is defined as the absolute value of $x$: $\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$.
- Omitting the absolute value can lead to sign errors and incorrect results.
- When rationalizing expressions involving square roots, correctly use the absolute value.
- $\text{Let } a = x^2 - 10$, Hence $ a = |\sqrt{a^2} | $, not simply $ a = \sqrt{a^2}$

## Even Roots and Multiple Solutions
-   When solving equations involving even roots (square root, fourth root, etc.) or fractional exponents with even denominators, remember to consider both positive and negative solutions.
-   The parity of the denominator in fractional exponents is the key to determining the number of real solutions.
-   Using modulus helps to remember this.

#### Fractional Exponents
-   A fractional exponent $a^{m/n}$ can be interpreted as $(a^{m})^{1/n}$ or $(a^{1/n})^{m}$.
-   The denominator $n$ represents the root index.
-   If $n$ is even, it represents an even root.
-   If $n$ is odd, it represents an odd root.

## Interval Calculations and Inclusive vs. Exclusive Differences
-   When calculating the length of an interval [a, b] using b - a, we are conceptually taking an "inclusive difference" as we are finding the distance between the two endpoints, which inherently includes these endpoints.
-   However, because we are working with continuous real numbers, the contribution of the individual endpoints to the overall length of the interval is negligible.
-   Therefore, in practice, the calculation b - a yields the same result as if we were taking an "exclusive difference."
-   In continuous mathematics, the minus sign represents "continuous difference" (exclusive difference) with negligible inclusivity.
-   The endpoints don't significantly affect the interval length.
-   We must be aware of this nuance to avoid misinterpretations, even though standard notation doesn't explicitly distinguish between these concepts.

#### Applying Inclusive vs. Exclusive Differences in Problem Solving
-   When calculating the percentage of an interval where a function is increasing, we use exclusive differences for the increasing intervals and inclusive difference (with negligible inclusivity) for the total interval.
-   For example, in the problem: "Determine the percentage of the interval [-6, 4] on which f(x) = 7 + 10x³ - 5x⁴ - 2x⁵ is increasing," we calculated:
    -   Increasing interval lengths: $| -3 - 0 | + | 0 - 1 |$ (exclusive differences)
    -   Total interval length: $| -6 - 4 |$ (inclusive difference with negligible inclusivity)
-   This explicit use of inclusive and exclusive differences, and separation of operations for the roots, makes the calculations more clear and easier to follow.

## Perpendicular Slopes
-   The slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope $m_y$ is denoted as $m_{\perp}$ and calculated as $m_{\perp} = -1 / m_y$.

# Precalculus Revisit - Best Practices

## Polynomial Inequalities

#### Solving Polynomial Inequalities
-   To solve inequalities like $(z^2)(3 + z)(2 - z) > 0$, find the roots of the expression.
-   Analyze the sign of each factor in the intervals defined by the roots.
-   Construct a sign table or number line to determine the sign of the entire expression in each interval.
-   Remember the multiplicity of roots, as it affects sign changes.
-   Adjust the solution based on whether the inequality is strict (>, <) or non-strict (≥, ≤).
-   Example: $(z^2)(3 + z)(2 - z) > 0$ yields the solution $(-3, 0) \cup (0, 2)$.

#### Visual Representation of Roots in Inequalities
-   When drawing a number line to evaluate inequalities, mark the roots with filled-in circles to differentiate them from points where the function is undefined or x-intercepts that are not roots.
-   This visual distinction clarifies which points are included in the solution set and which are not.

#### Quadratic Inequalities Using Absolute Values
-   For inequalities like $x^2 - 9 < 0$, isolate $x^2$ and take the square root of both sides.
-   Use the absolute value: $|x| < 3$, which leads to $-3 < x < 3$.
-   Be cautious with $x^2 < n, \text{ where } n < 0 $, as there are no real solutions.
-   Complex number inequalities are handled differently, and the "less than" relation doesn't apply directly.

## Explicitly Showing Constant Factors in Equations
-   Explicitly show constant factors when simplifying equations to maintain clarity and rigor.
-   Dividing an equation by a constant creates an equivalent, but not identical, equation.
-   This practice avoids potential errors, especially in complex expressions.
-   This is very important for mathematical rigor.
-   This is important when working with expressions outside of polynomials.
-   Especially important when the constant factor is negative and the expression is a polynomial inequality.
-   Instead of writing $-2x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0$ as $x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0$ straightaway, maintain the factor throughout as $-2(x^2 - 2x + 3) = 0$

#### Negative Constant Factors in Polynomial Inequalities
-   Negative constant factors significantly impact the sign analysis of polynomial inequalities.
-   They flip the sign of the entire expression and reverse the end behavior of the polynomial.
-   Explicitly showing negative constant factors ensures accurate sign analysis and avoids errors in the solution.

## Polarity-Pair Signage (±)
-   When multiplying or dividing an expression containing $\pm$ by a negative number, the order of the $\pm$ signs flips to $\mp$
-   Explicitly showing this step is crucial for accuracy and clarity, even if the final result is the same.
-   Skipping this step can lead to misunderstandings and debugging problems in complex calculations.
-   It is important to remember that the process is as important as the answer.

## Simplifying Complex Fractions
-   When dealing with complex fractions or fractions with large denominators, it is often clearer and more efficient to separate the denominator as a factor.
-   This improves clarity, reduces errors, and can sometimes simplify the expression.
-   For example, instead of writing $\dfrac{3x^2 + 5x - 2}{7x^3 - 4x^2 + 1}$, write $\dfrac{1}{7x^3 - 4x^2 + 1} (3x^2 + 5x - 2)$.
-   Collapse the fraction back when it is simplified.

## Ordering Terms in Polynomials
-   Write polynomials in standard form (descending order of exponents) for clarity and ease of further calculations.
-   This is especially important when factoring or performing polynomial division.
-   Improves communication and readability.
-   $5x - 2x^3 + 7 + x^4 \Longrightarrow a x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x + 7$

## Exponential Form vs. Radical Form for Derivatives
-   Exponential form is often preferred for differentiation due to its simplicity and compatibility with the power rule.
-   It reduces the risk of errors and simplifies the chain rule.
-   Unless explicitly asked for radical form, it is acceptable, and often better, to leave the answer in exponential form.
-   Radical form can lead to notational ambiguity.
- $\dfrac{1}{4 \sqrt[5]{x^3}}$ may be read as $\dfrac{1}{4^5\sqrt{x^3}} $
- Therefore, we should write it as $\dfrac{1}{4} x^{-\frac{3}{5}}$ to avoid ambiguity

# Mental Optimisations

## Multiplication of Fractions and Integers (Mental Calculation)
-   When multiplying a fraction by an integer, factor the integer to facilitate mental cancellation with the denominator.
-   Visualize the cancellation to reduce cognitive load and improve speed and accuracy.
-   This technique is beneficial for calculus calculations, especially with derivatives.
-   For $(3/8) \times 24$, instead of directly multiplying, factor $24$ as $3 \times 8$. Then, $\frac{3}{8} \times (3 \cdot 8) = 3 * 3 = 9$

## Efficient Factoring Techniques
-   Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) and factor it out.
-   Mentally divide each term by the GCF and write the result directly.
-   Visualize cancellation to speed up the process.
-   This is crucial for simplifying expressions in calculus.
-   Factor $12x^3 - 18x^2 + 6x$. The GCF is $6x$. Factoring it out gives $6x(2x^2 - 3x + 1)$

# Linear Equations, Derivatives, and Relativity of Stasis

## Re-deriving the Linear Equation
  - Started with the slope formula: $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
  - Generalized to: $m = \dfrac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$
  - Rearranged to point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
  - Isolated y to get: $y = mx + (y_1 - mx_1)$.
  - Recognized that $(y_1 - mx_1)$ is the y-intercept (c or B).
  - It was noted that, at $x=0$ and $y_1-mx_1 = y$, which is the y-intercept.
  - The importance of $x_1$ and $y_1$ being constants, and not variables, was found to be key to the resulting linear equation.
  - Constant functions are also linear, where $m=0$.

## Derivatives, Differentials, and Historical Context

#### 1. Leibniz's Intuition
- Leibniz, one of the inventors of calculus, used infinitesimals ($dy$, $dx$) as "impossibly small" quantities.
- This approach was intuitive and productive, leading to many discoveries.
- However, it lacked rigorous foundations within the standard real number system, leading to paradoxes and inconsistencies.

#### 2. The Limit-Based Solution
- Cauchy and Weierstrass, in the 19th century, developed the modern limit-based approach.
- The derivative ($\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ or $\dfrac{d}{dx} y$) is defined as the limit of the ratio of small changes: $\lim_{\delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\delta y}{\delta x}$.
- This is a process definition, instead of a static one.
- $\dfrac{d}{dx}$ is an operator that finds the derivative.
- $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ can be manipulated like a ratio, but its rigorous foundation lies in limits.
- Differentials ($dy$, $dx$) represent infinitesimally small changes, not just arbitrary small constants, but as a process.
- This process definition allows us to do manipulations about $dy$ and $dx$ as if they were fractions in the static sense, because within this newer broader definition, they still are, in the dynamic process sense.
- It was understood that the limit definition is the only way to correctly define the process of a derivative using the real number system.

## Relativity of Stasis in Variable Manipulation

#### Traditional View
Variables are treated as static entities with inherent, fixed values.

#### New perspective
The true foundation of variable manipulation is the *relativity* between variables.


#### **Stasis is not an inherent property of individual variables; it arises from their relationships**
  - The ability to manipulate variables as if they have stasis stems from the *relative stasis* of their processes.
  - This has implications in areas like differential equations and physics.
  - It was understood that "impossibly small" cannot be treated as a static, definable quantity.
  - The $dx = 2dx$ paradox highlights that infinitesimals cannot exist as static values.
  - A process can be treated as a state, when the process has a known relationship to another process.
  - The old understanding of variables being static collapses when the understanding of relativity is used.

# Deriving the Product Rule for Multiple Functions Using Induction

### Introduction

The product rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that helps us find the derivative of a product of functions. We are familiar with the product rule for two functions, but what about the product of more functions? In this notebook, we will derive the formula for the product rule for four functions and then generalize it to any number of functions using mathematical induction.

### Product Rule for Four Functions

Let's say we have four functions, f, g, h, and w. We want to find the derivative of their product:

$$(fghw)'$$

We can derive this using the standard product rule for two functions repeatedly.

Let $u = f$ and $v = (ghw)$. Then:

$$(fghw)' = (uv)' = u'v + uv' = f'(ghw) + f(ghw)'$$

Now, we need to find $(ghw)'$. Let $u = g$ and $v = (hw)$. Then:

$$(ghw)' = (uv)' = u'v + uv' = g'(hw) + g(hw)'$$

And finally, we need to find $(hw)'$. Let $u = h$ and $v = w$. Then:

$$(hw)' = (uv)' = u'v + uv' = h'w + hw'$$

Substituting back, we get:

$$(ghw)' = g'(hw) + g(h'w + hw') = g'hw + gh'w + ghw'$$

And then:

$$(fghw)' = f'(ghw) + f(g'hw + gh'w + ghw') = f'ghw + fg'hw + fgh'w + fghw'$$

Therefore, the product rule for four functions is:

$$(fghw)' = f'ghw + fg'hw + fgh'w + fghw'$$

### Generalizing the Product Rule Using Mathematical Induction

We can generalize this formula to any number of functions using mathematical induction.

**1. Base Case (n = 2):**

The product rule for two functions is:

$$(f_1f_2)' = f_1'f_2 + f_1f_2'$$

This is already proven and accepted as true.

**2. Inductive Hypothesis:**

Assume the product rule holds for $n$ functions. That is, assume:

$$(f_1f_2...f_n)' = f_1'f_2...f_n + f_1f_2'...f_n + ... + f_1f_2...f_n'$$

**3. Inductive Step (Prove for n + 1):**

We need to prove that the product rule holds for $n + 1$ functions. Let's write the product of $n + 1$ functions as:

$$(f_1f_2...f_nf_{n+1})'$$

We can group the first $n$ functions as one function, say $g$:

$$g = f_1f_2...f_n$$

Then, we have:

$$(f_1f_2...f_nf_{n+1})' = (gf_{n+1})'$$

Now, apply the product rule for two functions:

$$(gf_{n+1})' = g'f_{n+1} + gf_{n+1}'$$

By the inductive hypothesis, we know that:

$$g' = (f_1f_2...f_n)' = f_1'f_2...f_n + f_1f_2'...f_n + ... + f_1f_2...f_n'$$

Substitute this back into the equation:

$$(gf_{n+1})' = (f_1'f_2...f_n + f_1f_2'...f_n + ... + f_1f_2...f_n')f_{n+1} + (f_1f_2...f_n)f_{n+1}'$$

Distribute $f_{n+1}$:

$$(gf_{n+1})' = f_1'f_2...f_nf_{n+1} + f_1f_2'...f_nf_{n+1} + ... + f_1f_2...f_n'f_{n+1} + f_1f_2...f_nf_{n+1}'$$

This is exactly the product rule for $n + 1$ functions.

### Conclusion

We have derived the formula for the product rule for four functions and then generalized it to any number of functions using mathematical induction. This shows that the product rule can be extended to any number of functions, and the proof by induction provides a rigorous way to establish its validity.

## Summary of Learning Points: Limits, Differentiation, and the Constant Multiple Rule

- **Limits and Linearity:**
    - Limits are linear operators, meaning they distribute over addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
    - This is because the definition of a limit is inherently tied to the structure of linear spaces.
    - Limits *do* distribute over products and quotients (with the condition that the denominator's limit is non-zero).

- **Differentiation and Linearity:**
    - Differentiation is also a linear operator, inheriting the linearity properties from limits.
    - This leads to the Sum Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule.

- **Constant Multiple Rule:**
    - States that the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function: $\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)] = c \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$.
    - Can be proven using the limit definition of the derivative.

- **Difference Quotients:**
    - The derivative is defined as the limit of a difference quotient: $f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$.
    - The product of two difference quotients is *not* the difference quotient of the product of the functions.
    - The product rule for derivatives is derived by manipulating the difference quotient of the product of two functions.

- **Why the Product Rule is Necessary:**
    - Differentiation doesn't simply distribute over the product of functions due to the way the difference quotient is constructed.
    - The product rule accounts for the interaction between the two functions being multiplied.

## Summary of Learning Points: Product Rule vs. Expansion and Power Rule

- **Derivative of Exponential Functions:**
    - The derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$.
    - The derivative of $n^x$ is $n^x \ln(n)$.
    - The limit $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{n^h - 1}{h} = \ln(n)$ can be derived using L'Hôpital's rule or series expansion.

- **Product Rule vs. Expansion and Power Rule:**
    - While the product rule is a fundamental differentiation rule, it's not always the most efficient method for calculations.
    - For polynomial expressions, expanding the product and applying the power rule is generally faster and less error-prone.
    - The product rule is more useful when dealing with functions that cannot be easily expanded (e.g., products of trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions).

- **Algebraic Simplification:**
    - Simplifying expressions before differentiation can significantly reduce the complexity of the calculation and minimize the risk of errors.
    - This is especially important when dealing with radicals and fractional exponents.

- **Error Prevention:**
    - Carefully review algebraic rules and double-check your work, especially when dealing with complex expressions.
    - Use the most efficient method to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential for errors.

# Process Philosophy

### Process vs. Outcome
-   Focusing on the process, rather than the final goal, aligns with the dynamic nature of reality.
-   Clinging to a fixed "final goal" can lead to disappointment and hinder the experience of the present moment.
-   Enjoying the process fosters resilience and adaptability.

### Balance of "Clinging"
-   Language, logic, mathematics, and technology are necessary tools, but excessive reliance on them can separate us from direct experience.
-   The key is to find a balance between using these tools effectively and maintaining openness to the fluidity of experience.

### Daoism and Buddhism: Two Sides of the Same Coin
-   Both philosophies recognize reality as process and impermanence.
-   Daoism emphasizes flow (Dao) and effortless action (Wuwei).
-   Buddhism emphasizes impermanence, non-self, and non-clinging to alleviate suffering.

#### Practical Application Differences
-   Daoism: Provides a framework (Dao, Wuwei) and encourages user discovery and experience to understand its efficacy. User explains why the framework works.
-   Buddhism: Provides explicit instructions (Eightfold Path, mindfulness) on how to apply the framework of non-clinging. User derives the whole framework from experience.
-   Daoism is more like mentorship, while Buddhism is more like a guided course.

#### Teaching Styles
-   Daoism: Teaches through framework and discovery.
-   Buddhism: Teaches through instructions and guided practice.
