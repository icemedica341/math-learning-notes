## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks documenting various mathematical concepts, proofs, and explorations. The notebooks are organized by mathematical discipline and include both theoretical explanations and practical examples.

## Installation

To use these notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter installed. You can set up the environment using either the provided `environment.yml` file (for conda) or `requirements.txt` (for pip).

### Using Conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate math-learning
```

### Using Pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
