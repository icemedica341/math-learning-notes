## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting various mathematical concepts, proofs, and explorations. The notes are organized by mathematical discipline and include both theoretical explanations and practical examples. Additionally, this repository includes Chinese translations of many notes to make the content accessible to Chinese-speaking learners.

Most notes are in **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** format, which renders natively in GitHub with full MathJax support for LaTeX equations. A small number of notes are in **Markdown (.md)** format — these are marked with a † symbol.

## Installation

To work with the notes locally, you'll need Jupyter installed. Set up the environment using either the provided `environment.yml` file (for conda) or `requirements.txt` (for pip).

### Using Conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate math-learning
```

### Using Pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The notes are **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)** which render natively in your browser on GitHub with full LaTeX support. To work with them locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/icemedica341/MathLearningNotes.git
   ```

2. Set up the environment as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Navigate to the notebook of interest and open it.

You can also browse the notebooks directly on GitHub — it renders them with MathJax for proper LaTeX display.
